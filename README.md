# Employee Database

## Description
For this project, I created a dynamic database that allows the user to add employees for a given workspace. When the user opens the program, he or she is met with a series of prompts that allows him or her to add employees, roles, and departments and view all current employees, roles, and departments. When the user selects one of the add prompts, he or she will be met with a series of question pertaining to that particular addition, whether it be an employee, role, or department. When the user selects on of the view prompts, he or she is met with a table laying out the necessary information for the user's selection.

## Requirements
The user must use npm i in the integrated terminal to install express, inquirer, and mysql. These are required to run the program.
